# egg land
 collect my eggs..

 here is where i store things that egg land locally pulls from (whether that be images, videos, etc), and eventually art assets for people to dig around in.

 # game description

 Egg Land is a idle game where you must click and find other ways of getting eggs and other unconventional currencies, with an interactive twist found nowhere else.
 
 "after months of job turn-downs, you finally get a job at The Egg Factory. when flying out to your new job, you end up on a seemingly deserted island, forced to make eggs with whatever is available on your cloud shop, and your own hands."
 
 collect and grow your egg count and you just might be able to escape this island.
