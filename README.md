# Egg Land
This GitHub page is where I store things that the game Egg Land locally pulls from (whether that be images, videos, etc).

Eventually, art assets and other things will be available for people to dig around in. 

this is **NOT** where you download the game.

# What's an Egg Land?

Egg Land is a incremental/idle game with an interactive twist. Click, collect, and discover unusual ways to generate eggs and other unconventional currencies—but don’t get too comfortable! Mysterious creatures might try to steal your supply (or potentially worse!), while friendlier faces might lend a hand in your bizarre quest.

After many turn-downs and rejections, Jacko Catacomb finally gets a job at The Egg Factory, but there's a catch. shipped off to a seemingly abandoned island, tasked with producing virtual eggs using an odd array of company devices. The kicker? He's able to trade them out for real (non-egg-shaped) money, and after he hits his quota, he gets to go home.
 
Grow your egg count, unravel the island’s secrets, and help Jacko expose the corporation’s evil history—before it breaks him… or the island’s inhabitants.
