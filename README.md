# Egg Land
This GitHub page is where I store things that the game Egg Land locally pulls from (whether that be images, videos, etc).

Eventually, art assets (such as .aseprite files) and other things will be available for people to mess around in.

This is **NOT** where you download the game.

# What's an Egg Land?

Egg Land is an in-beta incremental/idle games. Click, collect, and discover more unusual ways to generate eggs and other unconventional currencies—but don’t get too comfortable! Mysterious creatures might try to steal your supply (or potentially worse!), while friendlier faces might lend a hand in your bizarre quest.

After many turn-downs and rejections, local screwball Jacko Catacomb finally gets a job at The Egg Factory, but of course, there's a catch. He has to be shipped off to a seemingly deserted island, tasked with producing virtual eggs using an odd array of company devices. The kicker? He's able to trade them out for real (non-egg-shaped) money, and after he hits his quota, he gets to go home.
 
Grow your egg count, make some friends, unravel the island’s secrets, and expose The Egg Factory’s evil history, before something horrible happens to you—or everyone else.
